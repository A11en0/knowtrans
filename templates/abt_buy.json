    "rules_000": "Consider the following attributes when making your decision:\n- Prioritize the recognition of model numbers as key identifiers. If the model numbers match, this is a strong indication that the products may be the same, even if other attributes like color differ.\n- Handle cases with incomplete data carefully: if one product lacks a detailed description but shares key identifiers like model numbers or significant attributes with the other, consider them potentially the same.\n- Be aware of synonymous terms and different naming conventions that may refer to the same product. Check for alternative names or terms that are commonly used interchangeably.\n- Recognize that variations such as color, minor design elements, or finish (e.g., black vs. red) may not signify different products if they share the same model number or core specifications.\n- Focus on the overall functionality and core features of the products. If the descriptions imply they serve the same purpose, they may be the same product despite minor descriptive differences.\n- When dealing with different model numbers, verify if they belong to a series or product line that shares key characteristics, which could still imply the same fundamental product with variations.\n- Emphasize implicit matching: understand that an incomplete description does not necessarily indicate a different product if the available information aligns significantly with the other product's details."
